# Atomic

High‑performance, PSR‑friendly PHP building blocks. Our focus is on:

- Performance first: compile‑time optimizations and zero‑overhead execution paths
- Simplicity: small, focused libraries with clear responsibilities
- Interop: strict adherence to PSR standards (PSR‑7/11/12/15)
- Quality: comprehensive tests, static analysis, and consistent code style

Packages
- http-kernel — Ultra‑slim PSR‑15 kernel with compile‑time middleware pipelines
- router — Blazingly fast PSR‑7/15 router with static and parameterized routes
- container — Lightweight PSR‑11 DI container with compile‑time preparation

Guiding principle
“An idiot admires complexity, a genius admires simplicity.” — Terry A. Davis
